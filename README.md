# **Context**
- Rossmann is a pharmaceutical company in Europe, with over 1,115 stores spread throughout Europe.
- At the end of each month, a meeting is held with all store managers to discuss the results achieved and not achieved.
- The CFO asked all managers to provide a Sales Forecast for the next 6 weeks for each store.

# **Challenge**
## Problem
- In fact, the CFO is having difficulty defining the renovation budget for each store.

## Causes
- Current sales forecast shows a lot of divergence.
- The sales forecast process is based on past experiences.
- All sales forecasts are done manually by Rossmann's 1,115 stores.
- Sales visualization is limited to the computer.

## Solution
- Use Machine Learning to perform Sales Forecasts for All Stores.
- Sales Predictions can be viewed on a Smartphone.
